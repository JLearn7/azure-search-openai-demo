Biomedical Engineer,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/departments/health-sciences-education/careers/career-options/biomedical-engineer,"Biomedical engineers work with mathematics, science, and medicine to invent or enhance various technologies that improve the function of the human body. Some biomedical engineers design computer programs and circuits for magnetic resonance imaging and X-ray machines. Others work with devices such as cochlear implants and pacemakers implanted directly into the body. The field of biomedical engineering even extends to the development of new kinds of drug therapy. Biomedical engineers work with simulations and statistics to analyze the way the body works. For example, they might look at the signals a certain organ or limb is sending to the brain and then work to develop an artificial organ, limb, joint, or heart valve to help patients who need that particular body part replaced. Nanotechnology means of communication, rehabilitation equipment, robotics, and the possibilities for biomedical engineering extend into many different scientific fields.","Generally, biomedical engineers work in environments pertaining to research and development, however, there are many branches of biomedical engineering, and the direction of any given engineer's career path may be predicated on their interests and the direction they take their education (see below).","Although the minimum education requirement to enter the field of biomedical engineering is a four-year bachelor's degree, many biomedical engineers choose to pursue their education at a graduate level. Frequently, students will choose a master's or doctoral degree in biomedical engineering, which is for those looking to pursue a career in research and development. However, there is also a percentage of students who earn their bachelor's degree in biomedical engineering or a related field and then go on to attend medical or dental school. Some earn their graduate degrees in business to manage biomedical engineering companies and there are even some who attend law school to concentrate on intellectual property laws concerning developments in biomedical engineering.","According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics , the median salary for biomedical engineers is approximately $100,730 per year.",The Biomedical Engineering Society,https://www.bmes.org/,Biomedical engineering; Biomedical Engineering Education,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/departments/health-sciences-education/training-programs/affiliate-training-programs/biomedical-engineering; https://www.lerner.ccf.org/biomedical-engineering/education/

Angiography Technologist,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/departments/health-sciences-education/careers/career-options/angiography-technologist,"An angiography technologist (or an interventional radiologist, as they are sometimes known) uses an imaging technique called angiography to visualize the inside, or lumen, of blood vessels and organs of the body, with particular interest in the arteries, veins, and heart chambers. This is traditionally done by injecting a radio-opaque contrast agent into the blood vessel and imaging using X-ray-based techniques such as fluoroscopy. The film or image of the blood vessels is called an angiograph, or more commonly, an angiogram. Depending on the type of angiogram, access to the blood vessels is gained most commonly through the femoral artery, to look at the left side of the heart and the arterial system or the jugular or femoral vein, to look at the right side of the heart and the venous system. Using a system of guide wires and catheters, a type of contrast agent (which shows up by absorbing the X-rays), is added to the blood to make it visible on the X-ray images. The X-ray images taken may either be still images, displayed on an image intensifier or film, or motion images. For all structures except the heart, the images are usually taken using a technique called digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Images in this case are usually taken at 2 - 3 frames per second, which allows the radiologist to evaluate the flow of the blood through a vessel or vessels. This technique ""subtracts"" the bones and other organs so only the vessels filled with contrast agents can be seen. The heart images are taken at 15-30 frames per second, not using a subtraction technique. Because DSA requires the patient to remain motionless, it cannot be used on the heart. Both these techniques enable the radiologist or cardiologist to see stenosis (blockages or narrowing) inside the vessel which may be inhibiting the flow of blood and causing pain.",Hospitals Clinics Labs Outpatient centers,The American Registry of Radiologic Technologists requires that candidates seeking certification as an interventional radiology technologist must already hold certification in radiography.
