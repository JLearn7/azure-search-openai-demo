Students are encouraged to present projects at state and national meetings. The clinical curriculum provides broad educational experience at Cleveland Clinic's main campus, a quaternary care referral center, and regional hospitals/ambulatory surgery centers for specialty experiences. Simulation augments skills in airway management, positioning, spinal & epidural placement, and peripheral nerve blocks, utilizing live models and cadavers. Students consistently exceed national requirements for case variety and complexity, with opportunities for regional anesthesia, peripheral nerve blocks, and invasive line placement. Senior year offers opportunities for international mission work through CWRU. The complete listing of courses can be found at the CWRU website.

### **Dietetic Internship**
* **URL:** [https://my.clevelandclinic.org/departments/digestive/medical-professionals/education/dietetic-internship](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/departments/digestive/medical-professionals/education/dietetic-internship)
* **Overview:** Not Found
* **Application Information:** To be considered for acceptance into the Dietetic Internship Program, candidates must complete a graduate degree prior to starting the internship OR be enrolled with a graduation date planned no later than summer of the same year completing the internship. Candidate must:
    * Complete all required course work accredited or approved by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.
    * Present a Verification Statement or Declaration of Intent.
    * Effective January 1, 2024, the Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR) requires a minimum of a master’s degree to be eligible to take the credentialing exam to become a registered dietitian - nutritionist (RDN). For more information about this requirement visit CDR's website: [https://www.cdrnet.org/graduatedegree](https://www.cdrnet.org/graduatedegree).
    * Graduates who successfully complete the ACEND-accredited Dietetic Internship program at Cleveland Clinic and also obtain a master's degree, are eligible to apply to take the CDR credentialing exam to become an RDN.
    * The program supports applicants choosing various pathways to achieve required nutrition and graduate coursework. Cleveland Clinic dietetic interns may choose to enroll in the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Master of Nutrition program, which can be completed while interning full time. For more information, contact Stephanie Harris, PhD, RDN, LD at stephanie.harris@case.edu.
    * While state interpretations vary, ACEND considers the program to meet educational requirements for dietetics licensure and certification in all states. However, completing an ACEND-accredited academic program alone does not qualify an individual for licensure or certification; individuals should review state licensing statutes.
